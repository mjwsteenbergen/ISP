In this course, we will review the current state of the art on security research and gain practical experience in assessing the security and vulnerabilities of communication systems. Engineers are typically taught to focus on performance, correctness, scalability, and maintainability when building communication and information processing systems. However, an additional set of design principles are required to achieve security. In this course, we discuss security principles, common pitfalls and vulnerabilities. \\n\\nThe weekly lectures provide an introduction into security research, with a focus on real-world security, privacy-enhancing technology and common security pitfalls.\\n\\nEach student participates in a &quot;Hack Project&quot;, with a group of one to four students. Students can select between a wide range of available Hack Project outlines within the first week. The goal may be to evaluate the security of a real-world IT system, developing a proof-of-concept exposing a vulnerability or focussed on preserving privacy in a post-Snowden world. Students may propose their own Hack Project based on their background knowledge and skills. Such Hack Projects need to be approved and shaped together with the instructor. Example of possible outlined hardware-oriented projects are: development of a wifi tracker, programing an FPGA system to break passwords, assess the security of RFID cards, or to transparently intercept Ethernet traffic. Concrete software projects are: hacking Bitcoin, improving the TOR anonymity protocol and create Android-based tools for human rights activists in Iran, Egypt and Russia. \\n\\nEach Hack Project is documented with a written report. This can be in the form of a 6-8 page IEEE-style scientific article or a traditional more lengthy report. All results, experiences and findings are presented to the entire class in the last week of the course. Hack Projects also report their progress several times during the course, after the weekly lectures.","studyGoals":"After this course, the student will have a thorough knowledge of security in real-world systems, and will be able to explore the literature on this topic independently. \\nThe student will be aware of the poor state of security in real-world computer systems.

Strategic renewal can fueled by internal entrepreneurial behavior, as well as by initiating start-ups and aqcuiring start-ups to experiment with new technology. Many times, these start-ups originate in academic environments. Therefore we pay specific attention to the emergence of academic spin-outs and how these are connected to the interests of large international organizations through incubation facilities and venture capital support.\\nThis course examines the various forms of corporate entrepreneurship and the relationship with corporate strategy in particular. You will develop knowledge and skills to analyze strategic situations and design the most appropriate solutions in terms of corporate entrepreneurship strategy and organization.","studyGoals":"?\\tYou will develop a thorough understanding of corporate entrepreneurship; the contexts, the forms, and the relationship with strategic management.\\n?\\tYou will develop skills to analyze strategic situations and design appropriate corporate entrepreneurship strategies and organizations.\\n?\\tYou will be able to analyse the contribution of internal and external ventures in the renewal of large corporates.\\n?\\tYou will understand the emergence of academic spin-offs and how they relate to the technology development of large established organisations.\\n?\\tYou will understand the emergence of academic spin-offs and how they relate to the technology development of large established organisations.\\n?\\tYou will be able to identify the various key actors that facilitate and support the emergence of new business ventures and academis spin-offs","assessment":"We distinguish between three grading components:\\n1.

Our ability to cope with the increasing complexity of software systems is limited by the programming languages we use to build them. Bridging the gap between domain concepts and the implementation of these concepts in a programming language is one of the core challenges of software engineering. Modern programming languages have considerably reduced this gap, but often still require low-level programmatic encodings of domain concepts. Or as Alan Perlis formulated it in one of his famous epigrams: A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant. A fixed set of (Turing Complete) programming constructs is sufficient to express all possible computations, but at the expense of considerable encoding that obfuscates the concepts under consideration. Linguistic abstraction can be used as a tool to capture our emerging understanding of domains of computation.&quot; (Visser, SCP 2014) \\n\\nIn the precursor compiler construction course (IN4303), students learn the basics of language engineering and build a complete definition for a small programming language.

You will get an overview of the state-of-the-art, learn about the most promising approaches to realising quantum hardware, and critically assess the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. You will also get insight in the conceptual similarities and differences between the various technologies. \\n\\nSpecifically, the course will cover general concepts and considerations of qubit hardware, trapped ions, superconducting circuits, quantum dots, impurities, cold atoms, photonic circuits, single-photon sources, single-photon detectors and quantum repeaters.","studyGoals":"To acquire a good understanding of the requirements of quantum hardware both at the conceptual level and at the practical level.\\nTo acquire conceptual insight in the operation, opportunities, and challenges of various qubit realisations.\\nTo obtain a good overview of the state-of-the-art.\\nTo acquire the ability to critically read and understand research papers on relevant qubit realisations, and be able to place it in the proper context of the field.","assessment":"50% homework assignments, 20% in class quizzes, 30% presentations","educationMethod":"2 hours weekly lecture, 2x30mins student presentations, 15 min feedback on homework, 15 min quiz, literature study","courseYear":"2017/2018","responsibleInstructor":[],"otherInstructors":[],"tags":[{"tagName":"Master CS 2017"},{"tagName":"Other Specialisations 2017"},{"tagName":"Quantum Computing 2017"}],"lang":"English"},{"courseName":"Random Signal Processing","courseCode":"IN4309","ects":5.0,"quarterStart":1,"quarterLength":0,"examPeriod":0,"educationPeriod":0,"contactHours":"4/2/0/0","contents":"Signal processing plays a major role in many applications, like consumer electronics (mp3 player, mobile telephony, CD player, (HD)TV), radar and medical applications.\\n\\nIn this course we will discuss fundamental signal processing principles, methods and algorithms. The course consists of two parts: Part I: Stochastic Processes (given in Q1) and Part II: Digital Signal Processing (given in Q2). \\n\\nThe first part of the course introduces the concept of stochastic models and random processes, while the second part of the course focusses on deterministic signal processing. The stochastic models are used for describing systems and signals that are not deterministic. In fact, no single system or signal is deterministic in practice. For that reason the theory of stochastics and random processes should be considered as a useful extension of known approaches for describing and modeling systems and signals encountered in engineering practices. \\n\\nStochastic models will be developed on the basis of probability theory. Probability theory describes the behavior of certain phenomena in terms of how likely it is that certain values will occur. Central features of the models will be discussed are random variables, probability density functions, and the expected value operator. In describing random processes and signals, the correlation function and conditional probabilities play a central role. The part on deterministic signal processing will cover the representations of signals and systems in time-, frequency (Fourier) en Z-domains and the foundations of mathematical models for signal analysis and processing based on these representations.\\n\\nThe course addresses the following subjects:\\n1. Refresher random variables. Matlab exercise on estimation of PDF, expected value and variance. \\n2. Refresher correlation. Calculating with correlation functions. \\n3.

Therefore, the course also considers research in social web data analytics and data science techniques to extract user knowledge from social web data.\\n\\nOther topics that are addressed include the developments concerning the Semantic Web, with its main languages, theory and applications and tools for describing semantics in machine-processable manner, and the developments concerning the role of humans in the processing of web data, e.g. User-Generated Content and Crowdsourcing.\\n\\nAs the web and its data are mirroring the world and the people in it, the course also takes a look at Web Science, as a branch of data science that considers the largest human-made artefact ever, i.e. the Web, and how that research is addressing a whole new range of challenges.","studyGoals":"The student learns the important principles and concepts of web-based information systems and their engineering processes, and understands the main research challenges in the area.\\nThe student has knowledge about the main methods, techniques and languages used in the area of web-based information systems, in particular concerning web data. \\n\\nThe student has knowledge of the main principles and techniques for user modelling and adaptation, and of the role of Social Web data for user modelling.\\n\\nThe student learns the major challenges and principles from the research in the field of Web Science, and the role of web data for Web Science.\\nThe student is able to write a paper contributing to Web Science based on a problem in the field of web-based information systems.","assessment":"Assessment happens on the basis of the small assignments (accompanying the lectures), for 40% of the grade, and the large assignment (writing the web science paper), for 60% of the grade. The final paper needs to be graded with a 6.0 or higher. All assignments need to be completed by the indicated deadlines.","educationMethod":"The education includes:- Lectures, before which and after which students study material by themselves, to get an understanding of the relevant material;- Small assignments and hands-on exercises, to apply the understanding of relevant material;- One large assignment, with a number of feedback moments, to learn how to write a web science paper and contribute to relevant research.Lectures will be not each week in the class period (1+2): in between lectures there is time reserved for studying before and after lectures, for small assignments and exercises, and for writing the large assignment paper. The writing of the large assignment paper happens throughout the class period (1+2) to enable frequent feedback.","courseYear":"2017/2018","responsibleInstructor":[],"otherInstructors":[],"tags":[{"tagName":"Common Core DST 2017"},{"tagName":"Common Core ST 2017"},{"tagName":"EIT Master’s Programme ICT Innovation 2017"},{"tagName":"Information Architecture 2017"},{"tagName":"Master CS 2017"},{"tagName":"Research Groups 2017"},{"tagName":"Special Programmes 2017"},{"tagName":"Specialisation CCS 2017"},{"tagName":"Specialisation courses start first period 2017"},{"tagName":"Specialisation DMT 2017"},{"tagName":"Track Data Science & Technology 2017"},{"tagName":"Track Software Technology 2017"},{"tagName":"Web Information Systems 2017"},{"tagName":"Year 1 CCS 2017"},{"tagName":"Year 1 CCS The compulsory courses 2017"},{"tagName":"Year 1 DMT 2017"},{"tagName":"Year 1 DMT The compulsory courses 2017"}],"lang":"English"},{"courseName":"Wireless Networking","courseCode":"ET4394","ects":5.0,"quarterStart":3,"quarterLength":0,"examPeriod":0,"educationPeriod":3,"contactHours":"0/0/4/0","contents":"The following modules will be discussed during the lectures:\\n\\nIntroduction:\\n- What is wireless networking\\n- Where to search for wireless network literature and resources\\n\\nReview of networking basics:\\n- Protocol layers, TCP/IP stack, sockets, HTTP, WebStreaming\\n- Experiments with simple server/client application in Python\\n\\nMedium Access Control:\\n- WiFi: hidden/exposed terminal problem, Carrier Sense Multiple Access\\n- Bluetooth standard: in-depth look into the channel hopping, protocol specifications\\n\\nWiFi:\\n- Review of IEEE 802.11 standards\\n- Protocol format\\n- ISM band regulation\\n- MIMO/Space-Time Coding for WiFi\\n- Adaptive Modulation and Coding\\n- WiFi Matlab class (assignment)\\n\\nIoT networking standards:\\n- LoRa: protocol specifications, energy consumption, modulation format, network design\\n- NB-IoT: protocol specifications, modulation format, network design\\n\\nReview of wireless tools:\\n- Introduction to wireless packet sniffing and analysis using Wireshark (assignment)\\n- Introduction to Software Defined Radio\\n- Simple simulations of WiFi network with NS3\\n\\nRFID networking:\\n Principles of backscatter\\n- Protocol formats: EPC C1G2 and NFC\\n- RFID hackathon\\n\\nCognitive radio:\\n- Basics of spectrum management\\n- White Space Databases\\n- Theory of spectrum sensing\\n\\nHot topics in wireless networking:\\n- Overview of new areas of wireless networking, such as:\\n- Visible Light Communication\\n- Machine learning for wireless communications\\n- Human detection with WLAN\\n- Backscatter networks","studyGoals":"At the end of the course students will be able to: (i) to understand how practical wireless systems work and get a deeper understanding of how the theoretical concepts of wireless communications apply to practice; (ii) employ their own analysis methodology to assess new wireless network systems (especially at the physical layer); (iii) understand rapid prototyping of new wireless systems (for instance, with software defined radio).","assessment":"Points from the mini-project assignments (60% of the total grade) and a one hour written final exam (40% of the total grade).
